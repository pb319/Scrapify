#### Objective:
- Get first-hand experience with how to parse HTML(tags, classes) through `Beautiful Soup` to find single/multiple elements.
- Create a database of job descriptions, and specifications available on `www.timesjobs.com`.

#### Approach:
- We used a synthetic simple HTML page to understand how `Beautiful Soup` works. [HTML File](https://github.com/pb319/Scrapify/blob/main/home.html)
- Fetch multiple elements (`Posted, Company Name, Skill Requirements, More Info`) through API request.
- Finally export it as a CSV formatted file.
